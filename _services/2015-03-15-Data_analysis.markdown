What started as a way of speeding up my business is now a service I offer to clients with complex needs for structuring data.

- Stripping and filtering data (remove unwanted garbage, trailing text, spaces)
- Extracting data (pull relevant strings from files or sites)
- Sorting (sort by value, date, specific keyword)
- Create arrays, tables, columns (ingest large data sets and restructure into new formats)
- Programmatic scripting of data intake and delivery (e.g. invoice generation, EU central bank currency rate comparisons, creation of daily stubs and propagation of files)

If you have data, it can be transformed, out of a mess, of meaningless information and into usable, tangible insights for your business.

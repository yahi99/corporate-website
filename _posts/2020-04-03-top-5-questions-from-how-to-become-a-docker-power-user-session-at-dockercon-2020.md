<p>It was a fantastic experience hosting my first ever virtual conference session. The commute to my home office was great, and I even picked up a coffee on the way before my session started. No more waiting in lines, queueing for food, or sitting on the conference floor somewhere in a corner to check emails. </p>



<p>The “<a href="https://www.docker.com/blog/dockercon-2020-and-thats-a-wrap/">DockerCon 2020 that&#8217;s a wrap” blog post</a> highlighted my session &#8220;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUZxIWDUicA">How to Become a Docker Power User using VS Code</a>&#8221; session was one of the most popular sessions from DockerCon. Docker asked if I could write a recap and summarize some of the top questions that appeared in the chat. Absolutely.</p>



<p>Honestly, I liked the presented/audience interaction more than an in-person conference. Typically, a presenter broadcasts their content to a room full of participants, and if you are lucky and plan your session tempo well enough, you still have 5-10 minutes for Q&amp;A at the end. Even with 5-10 minutes, I find it is never enough time to answer questions, and people always walk away as they have to hurry to the next session.</p>



<p>Virtual Events allow the presenters to answer questions in real-time in the chat. Real-time chat is brilliant as I found a lot more questions were being asked compared to in-person sessions. However, we averaged about 5,500 people online during the session, so the chat became fast and furious with Q&amp;A.  </p>



<p>I quickly summarized the Chat transcript of people saying hello from countries/cities around the world. The chat kicked off with people from around the world chiming in to say &#8220;Hello from my home country/city. Just from the chat transcripts and people saying hello, I counted the following:</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Argentina 1&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Austria	 2&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Belgium	 1&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Brazil	 4&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Canada	 3&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Chile	 1&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Colombia	 1&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Denmark	 3&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;France	 3&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Germany	 3&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Greece	 2&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Guatemala	 1&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Italy	 	 1&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Korea	 	 1&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Switzerland	 3&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;UK		 3&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;USA		 15&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>  <strong>TOTAL</strong>   <strong>62</strong> </p>



<p><strong>Top 5 Questions</strong></p>



<p>Based on the Chat transcript, we summarized the top 5 questions/requests.</p>



<ol><li>The number one asked question was for the link to the demo code. VS Code demo Repo &#8211; <a href="https://github.com/vegasbrianc/vscode-docker-demo">https://github.com/vegasbrianc/vscode-docker-demo</a></li><li>Does VS Code support VIM/Emacs keybindings? Yes, and yes. You can either install the <a href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=vscodevim.vim">VIM</a> or <a href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=vscodeemacs.emacs">Emacs</a> keybinding emulation to transform VS Code to your favorite editor keybinding shortcuts.</li><li>We had several docker-compose questions ranging from can I run X with docker-compose to can I run docker-compose in production. Honestly, you can run docker-compose in production, but it depends on your application and use case. Please have a look at the <a href="https://github.com/dockersamples/example-voting-app">Docker Voting Application</a>, highlighting the different ways you can run the same application stack. Additionally, <a href="https://docs.docker.com/compose/">docker-compose documentation</a> is an excellent resource.</li><li>VS Code Debugging &#8211; This is a really powerful tool. If you select the Debug option when bootstrapping your project Debug is built in by default. Otherwise, you can <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/containers/debug-common">add the debug code manually</a>&nbsp;</li><li>Docker context is one of the latest features to arrive in the VS Code Docker extension. A few questions asked how to setup Docker contexts and how to use it. At the moment, you still need to set up a Docker Context using the terminal. I would highly recommend reading the<a href="https://www.docker.com/blog/how-to-deploy-on-remote-docker-hosts-with-docker-compose/"> blog post</a> by Anca Lordache wrote about using Docker Context as it provides a complete end-to-end set up of using Context with remote hosts</li></ol>



<p><strong>Bonus question!</strong></p>

How do I take a screenshot?
----------------------------

press   PrtScn  =  Windows captures the entire **screen** and copies it to the (invisible) **clipboard**. Note: On some notebooks you have to hold Fn and then press PrtScn instead.     ###  Where can I find that key?

PrtScn ScrLk Pause    Look for this group of keys at the **upper right** of your keyboard. Note: **Print Screen** (PrtScn) might have been abbreviated differently on your keyboard.      

How do I take a screenshot of a single window?
----------------------------

     hold down   Alt   and press   PrtScn  =  Windows captures only the currently active **window** and copies it to the **clipboard**.        


How do I take a screenshot of a specific area?
----------------------------

hold down   ⊞   and   Shift   and press   S  =  Use your mouse to draw a **rectangle** in order to specify what to capture. Windows then copies it to the **clipboard**. Since: Windows 10 Creators Update.        I guess it’s in the [clipboard](https://how-to-copy-and-paste.appspot.com/) now. 


How can I paste it into a document or something?
----------------------------

hold down   Ctrl   and press   V  =  Windows pastes the screenshot (that is in the **clipboard**) into a document or image you are currently editing.     

###  Where should I paste it? 

I just need a (graphics) file.

Start “Paint”
Paste
Save
type “paint” into the search field     

How do I take a screenshot and have it directly as a file?
----------------------------

Hold down   ⊞   and press   PrtScn  =  Windows (8 or 10) captures the entire **screen** and saves it as a file to your **Pictures** > **Screenshots** folder.


Is there a dedicated program for taking screenshots? How can I find it?
----------------------------

type “snip” into the search field
